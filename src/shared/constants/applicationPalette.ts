// Single fixed accent colour for ALL `application` (ArgoCD app) decorative group nodes.
// Used by:
//   * normalize.ts — assigned to every backend `type: "application"` container as
//     data.applicationColor (the grouping STRUCTURE comes from the backend's `parent`
//     field untouched; only the colour is a frontend/presentation concern).
//   * the legend's ApplicationLegend — the swatch must match the on-canvas backplate.
//
// One colour per KIND, not per instance: every application renders the SAME muted
// terracotta so the graph reads by nesting + the `application:` label prefix, not by a
// rainbow of per-name hues. Constraints (mechanically enforced by applicationPalette.test.ts):
//   (1) MUST NOT equal any STATUS colour (green/yellow/red) — never read as node health.
//   (2) MUST NOT equal any edge colour (EDGE_STYLE_BY_TYPE) — a low-saturation,
//       translucent backplate keeps the vivid edges legible where they cross it.
//   (3) MUST differ from CLUSTER_COLOR / NAMESPACE_COLOR so the nested cluster >
//       namespace > application boxes stay distinguishable.
