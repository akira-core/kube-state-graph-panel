// appears as a drawn edge in the default `controller` pod-parent mode; in `node`

// network hop through a middlebox, not the thing the pod actually depends on":

//     + traffic type) → `edge[?ingressPath]`

// data rather than a per-TYPE property. This map still owns colour/routing/base line-style
